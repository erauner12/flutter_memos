# Riverpod Implementation Strategy (Updated)

## Current Status

We've successfully optimized our Riverpod providers with best practices:

1. ✅ **Improved caching with keepAlive()**
2. ✅ **Enhanced error handling**
3. ✅ **Selective watching with ref.select()**
4. ✅ **Better provider organization**
5. ✅ **Resource cleanup with onDispose()**
6. ✅ **Comprehensive documentation**
7. ✅ **Performance optimizations**

## Code Generation Attempt

We attempted to set up Riverpod code generation but encountered dependency issues:

- Conflicts between analyzer versions and custom_lint packages
- Missing generated .g.dart files causing compilation errors
- Type errors for generated classes and references

## Moving Forward: Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Current Optimized Implementation (Complete)

We're currently using optimized traditional Riverpod providers which:

- Follow best practices documented in riverpod_best_practices.md
- Apply modern patterns like better caching and error handling
- Use provider naming and organization that prepares for future code generation

### Phase 2: Future Code Generation (Later)

When the ecosystem stabilizes and dependency issues are resolved:

1. Create a separate test project first to verify compatibility
2. Add riverpod_annotation and riverpod_generator dependencies
3. Start with converting simple providers
4. Progressively migrate more complex providers

## Using the Optimized Providers Now

All the optimizations we've made provide immediate benefits:

1. Better performance through selective watching and caching
2. Improved error handling with centralized error management
3. More maintainable code structure
4. Better debugging with provider logging
5. Enhanced user experience with optimistic updates

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. Continue following the patterns in the optimized providers
2. Use the riverpod_best_practices.md document as a guide
3. Periodically test code generation in an isolated project
4. Migrate to code generation when the ecosystem stabilizes

This approach gives us the benefits of modern Riverpod patterns now while keeping the door open for code generation in the future.
